            <h2>Modified Problem</h2>
            <p>In this problem, we increase the complexity by looking at a
                series of points on a plane. However, we restrict the walkway
                to be only horizontal.
            </p> 
            <h2>Randomized Optimization of Quasiconvex Programs</h2>
            <p>Unlike the previous problem, Cardinal et al. don't provide a 
                deterministic algorithm for generating an optimal walkway. 
                Instead, they show that the problem of finding an optimal 
                horizontal walkway in a plane can be solved using a variety of
                algorithms for solving quasiconvex programs</p>
